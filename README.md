# BAB Developer Objective Task - Spring 2021
## Introduction
Welcome to the Blockchain @ Berkeley objective task for Developers. This task is due this Friday 02/05/2021 at 11:59pm!

## The Tasks
You are given 2 tasks. Please complete them both receive full points. Make sure you are able to explain your thought process behind your solution. Lastly, this is not a collaborative task, so please do not work with others or plagiarize any code. 

For the coding questions, write solutions in Python 3 such that you pass the provided test cases and any test cases you can come up on your own. Remember, the code you write should provide the correct solution for all cases, not just the provided examples. 

**WARNING:** You should be writing custom test cases or evaluating them within the interpreter because there are a lot of cases we will be testing for. We are looking for clean, optimized code, so runtime and space matters, however so does convenience. Strike a reasonable balance and you'll do well.

If you are missing any relevant packages that are imported into the files by default, you can install them using `pip3`.

## Words of Encouragement
This is for us to gauge your level of comfort with various coding concepts, as well as your willingness to go out of your way to learn new things. We promise that the rest is much more relaxed. If you are an underclassman and you don't understand some of these question - that's fine, but you should keep trying and come to office hours if you need help!

Upperclassmen, you've probably seen more difficult questions, so we hope that you can answer these questions reasonably well.

Good luck and email diego.uribe@berkeley.edu if you have questions.

## Submission Instructions
*DO NOT FORK THIS REPO,* SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PUBLIC WILL BE DISQUALIFED. We ask that you do not share any solutions and work alone.

Instead, zip up the contents of the root of this repo and submit those using a google form: https://forms.gle/fkrQiH3Vxca3C12x6. Only submit completed tasks in the zip.

Do not change or rename the folder structure. We will be running autograders on these and if the format fails then we will not accept them as valid solutions.

*The contents of the zip file should be the folders in this repo.*
